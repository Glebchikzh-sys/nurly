**Nurly** is a premium, privacy-focused Islamic lifestyle application built with a focus on serenity, typography, and "Calm Tech" principles. It moves away from cluttered interfaces to provide a digital sanctuary for worship.

## ✨ Philosophy
*   **Atmosphere over Features:** Every screen is designed to be a "breath," not a dashboard.
*   **Soft UI:** Uses a "Warm Paper" (Light) and "Deep Night" (Dark) aesthetic.
*   **Respectful UX:** No gamification, no ads, no distractions.

## 🚀 Key Features
*   **Day Dashboard:** Elegant prayer times countdown with Hijri context.
*   **Noble Quran:** Custom typography rendering with zero layout shift.
*   **Smart Tasbih:** Tactile counter with intent-based session handling.
*   **Refinings:** A spiritual reflection engine with internal Ayah deep-linking.
*   **Ambient Mode:** Subconscious floating lines that create a living atmosphere.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
*   **Framework:** React 18
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Strict Design Tokens)
*   **Animation:** Framer Motion (Orchestrated Layouts)
*   **Logic:** Custom Hooks for Geolocation & Prayer Times
*   **Icons:** Lucide React

## 🎨 Design System
The app enforces a strict strict color palette using CSS Variables to ensure seamless Dark Mode transitions without "harsh" contrasts.

*   **Light:** Warm Beige (`#FFF8F1`) & Sage Green (`#6BBF8A`)
*   **Dark:** Deep Jungle (`#0C1E1A`) & Muted Gold (`#C9A86A`)
